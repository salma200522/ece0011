<u><h3>An introduction</h3></u>

Only humans are called the mind, because our mental abilities are important in every small and big thing in our lives just as important to us ourselves. The field of artificial intelligence means the mechanization of human intelligence and the study of its mental abilities. One of the most important reasons for studying artificial intelligence is our attempt to understand the operations of the human mind, my mind, your mind and the mind of every generous reader in a way that moves away from philosophy, psychology and anatomy, which in turn is also concerned with the human mind.
The science of artificial intelligence strives to build intelligence as far as it is concerned with understanding that intelligence. The second reason to study this science is that our smart program is useful in itself and effective in several areas of our lives that have become digital! Although no one can predict the details of the future, it is clear that the computer with human intelligence will have a huge and clear impact on our daily lives and in the manufacture of civilization.<br />Artificial intelligence is an important puzzle: How is it possible for this small brain, whether biological or electronic, to understand, perceive, predict and interact with a world larger and more complex than the brain itself? How can we take the path of making such a small brain with all its complex characteristics? This is a difficult question, but unlike the search for a means of transportation faster than the speed of light, the researcher in the science of artificial intelligence and the student will find that this science is based on solid and possible foundations, all he has to do is look in the mirror to find a living example of the intelligent system.
